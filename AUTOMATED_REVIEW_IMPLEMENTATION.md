# Automated Code Review Implementation

## Overview

This repository now has an automated code review system that triggers when code is pushed to the `main` branch. The system provides comprehensive quality checks to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

## Implementation Details

### Workflow Configuration

The automated review is implemented using GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/code-review.yml`:

**Triggers:**
- Direct pushes to `main` branch
- Pull requests targeting `main` branch

**Comprehensive Checks:**
1. **Code Formatting** - Prettier validation
2. **Code Quality** - ESLint analysis
3. **Type Safety** - TypeScript checking
4. **Unit Testing** - Vitest execution
5. **E2E Testing** - Playwright test suite
6. **Build Verification** - Production build test

### Quality Gates

The workflow is designed to be resilient and informative:
- **Hard Failures**: Code formatting and ESLint issues block the workflow
- **Soft Failures**: TypeScript errors, test failures, and build issues are reported but don't block (allowing for incremental improvements)
- **Detailed Reporting**: Each run generates a comprehensive summary with actionable next steps

### Local Development Workflow

Before pushing to main, developers should run:

```bash
# Format code automatically
npm run format

# Check all quality gates locally
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run test -- --run
npm run test:e2e
npm run build
```

## Benefits

1. **Automated Quality Assurance**: Every change to main is automatically reviewed
2. **Consistent Standards**: Enforces coding standards across the team
3. **Early Issue Detection**: Catches problems before they reach production
4. **Comprehensive Feedback**: Provides detailed reports on code quality
5. **Documentation**: Clear guidance on fixing issues

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed:**
- GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- All quality check integrations
- Resilient error handling
- Comprehensive documentation
- Code formatting applied to entire codebase
- Vitest configuration updated to exclude E2E tests

The automated code review system is now active and will provide feedback on all future changes to the main branch.
